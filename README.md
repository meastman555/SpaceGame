# SpaceGame

Created at Global Game Jam 2020, Space Game is a top-down arcade game for two people to play cooperatively.The theme was repair,
so the players must work together to repair satellites, while avoiding asteroids, repairing the ship if it gets hit.

During these 48 hours, I was responsible for scripting and some in-engine programming. Scripts I wrote can be found authored
in the Scripts folder.
