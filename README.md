SPACE GAME!!! 

Global Game Jam 2020
Theme: Repair

During these 48 hours I wrote several of the C# scripts and completed some of the in-engine programming. I was responsible for both ship and astronaut movement, scene transitions, controller support/mapping, a functioning main menu, among other small, miscellaneous tasks.

Scripts I wrote can be found in Global Game Jam 2020/Assets/Scripts
